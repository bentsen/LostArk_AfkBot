## About the bot

The bot will Automaticly be responsible for keeping you "active" in the game so you wont get timed out for being afk. It will do so by clicking in a random location in an area of 100 x 100 pixels every 10 to 15 minutes. This will ensure that you character will stay in the same position and not move go out for some crazy adventure.

3. Stand somewhere in the world with a little place (i like standing in my stronghold for privacy)
4. Press start and let the program take control over mouse - (dont disturb the program)
5. Go do what you are intended.
